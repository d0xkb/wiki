## **This is (finally) my endless text file replacement.**

Over last years when administrating different linux systems, I somehow realized, that _I really can't remember everything_ and then I start putting various commands to one single endless text file, using amazing tools like Ctr+F and grep to find something..

But now, _something_ changed my mind and I **finally** decided to somehow clean up _the file_ and sort content to sections, mainly for me, but maybe for you. As a result, I started this [wiki](https://github.com/dakb/wiki/wiki).
